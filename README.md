I forgot to mention that you actually do need python and the SimpleHTTPServer module (which might come with it- i dont remember installing it). You essentially run it by either doing
python -m http.server 8000
in a folder with all the attached files or just navigating to the folder once in the browser. The browser URL will then be http://localhost:8000/
The 8000 I think is an arbitrary port number. It's just the one everyone online was using so I used it too
